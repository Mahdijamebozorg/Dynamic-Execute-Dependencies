# Dynamic-Execute-Dependencies
An automation tool for copying dependencies of a dynamic-excute file into a lib file

copying all of a dynamic-execute file's dependencies takes a log time, and sometime some tools like cqtdeployer and linuxdeplyqt won't work (this happened to me)
so you should copy all dependencies your self, but with this simple tool you can automate this work and just give your binary file address as argument to this program and lib file will be done.
